The topic that I have chosen to examine using the Youtube crawler is life within Los Angeles, specifically Noho. The parameters I used for this search was the location I currently reside at of "Bellevue Washington" and the location I likely plan to move to in the future "North Hollywood California". I wanted to make this comparison because for the longest I've wanted to live in Los Angeles to pursue my dreams within the entertainment industry and all the while I've lived in Bellevue. I wanted to use this opportunity to compare some of the commonalites and differences that are present just in searching around about these places to get a better sense of the trends and patterns of each. By getting a better understanding, I can better decide whether its still worth it to move as I approach and am entering adulthood or if its better to just stay in Bellevue. 

In looking at the word clouds between the two areas, I actually see quite a few prominent differences between the two locations. On one end in North Hollywood, there seems to actually be quite a lot of concerning words that pop up such as robbery, shootout, police, armed, and more being some pretty common words that pop up within the search. Where as on the other side with Bellevue we see a lot more pleasant things such as lake, home, best, explore, luxury, city, walk, and more. I think that this is however likely due to more news coverage within major cities like LA documenting more of the crime and things that happen and those also receiving more views and traffic on Youtube for their content and intrigue. LA for sure has more crime, but I think that blogs and news sources are more proactive in documenting and posting those stories then in a city like Bellevue where not as much happens and there is not as much intrigue. 

This research could be improved in the future perhaps by having more words in the search query in order to find more specific results about a subject. For instance, in the demo if the search was "Standing Rock Native History" or "Standing Rock Pipeline", those results would have made for better research and findings since the findings and pool of words would be more centered around a specified topic. Also, I think it could be improved by having some way to eliminate not as credible videos in relation to the topic. This could be done by sorting through channel popularity by subscriber count or number of likes and ratings. While that could also have its downsides as more views and subscribers doesn't necessarily mean more credible, I think if the info is touching a wider audience it should be more considered within this specific method of using the crawler.

I think the map is pretty reflective of what I expected prior to doing the search however I would say that I was a bit surprised to see how much of media relating to north hollywood on youtube was related to crime and criminal activity with words like shootout being one of the larger ones displayed on the word cloud for the location. I expected it to be there but not be as prevalent as it was. I think I also expected to see more nature type words within the cloud for bellevue but I think there was still a fair representation of that in the cloud. Overall all though I would say my expecations were rather accurate.
